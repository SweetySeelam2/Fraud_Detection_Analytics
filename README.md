# 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Credit Card Fraud Detection System


An advanced, interactive, enterprise-grade fraud detection platform built with **XGBoost**, **SHAP**, and **Streamlit**. This solution identifies fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time with explainability and actionable business insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Credit card fraud costs businesses billions every year. This app tackles that challenge by:
- Predicting fraud using a trained **XGBoost classifier**
- Providing **SHAP + LIME explainability**
- Enabling **manual data upload or sampling**
- Offering **clear business ROI insights** for decision-makers

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time fraud prediction
- ✅ Upload your own CSV or test on demo samples
- ✅ Explainability using SHAP and LIME
- ✅ Business savings estimates per detection
- ✅ Multi-page Streamlit app for easy navigation

## 📁 Streamlit App Pages

### 🏠 Home  
Short description of the app, model, features.

### 📁 Upload/Test Data  
Upload your own CSV with `Time`, `V1–V28`, and `Amount` columns or use a balanced demo sample (1500 rows, includes both fraud and non-fraud cases for realistic testing).

### 🤖 Predict Fraud  
Predict fraudulent transactions, see probability scores, and download results.

### 📊 Explainability  
Visualize model behavior using:
- SHAP summary plots
- SHAP force plot for individual transactions
- LIME HTML report

### 📈 Business Insights  
Summarizes:
- 💰 Estimated savings ($500 saved per fraud caught)
- 📊 Detection rate
- 📎 Strategic recommendations

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle – Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Size**: ~285K transactions | 492 frauds | PCA-transformed features

⚠️ Due to GitHub size limits, the full dataset (`creditcard.csv`) is downloaded directly from **Google Drive** via script:

gdown.download(DRIVE_URL, CSV_FILE)

A separate, balanced sample dataset (test_demo.csv) is generated for unbiased demo/testing in the app (contains a representative mix of fraud and non-fraud cases).
---

## 💡 Business Impact

- 🎯 **Fraud detection rate**: ~99% on test sample
- 💵 **Avg savings per fraud caught**: $500
- 📉 **Potential savings per 10K transactions**: $100K+
- 📈 **ROI uplift**: 8–15% depending on transaction volume and manual review reduction

---

## 💼 Strategic Recommendations

- Integrate model into **payment authorization flow**
- Flag transactions >90% fraud probability
- Retrain model **quarterly** with new data
- Combine SHAP + LIME for **compliance auditing**
- Enable manual review dashboards for borderline cases
